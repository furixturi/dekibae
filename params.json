The source code of popular JavaScript libraries will be studied and discussed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why do we do THIS?\r\nThe idea came from the awkward moments prevalent to a routine frontend dev, with jQuery, jQuery plugins and JavaScript frameworks in her toolbox - \r\n\r\n```\r\nOccasionally, the external code behaves JUST NOT AS EXPECTED.\r\n```\r\n\r\nJumping in the project doc is naturally the first attempt at resolving the problem - and normally the failed attempt. We have no intention to judge the general doc quality or doc style in the front dev world, since there's no such thing here as a standard or a general solution. _It's just wild._\r\n\r\nSo we jump in the source. We peek in the implementation detail to figure out:\r\n\r\n#### How did they do THAT? ####\r\n\r\nHow did they conquered the problems with just plain old JavaScript? How did they then go one step further to make the solution cross browser and reusable? What was their special skills, tricks, and style?\r\n\r\nOnly in this way we finally stand on the same ground as the masters / innovators / visionaries who developed the toolset for us. \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
